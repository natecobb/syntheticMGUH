The patient is a 45-year-old female who presents today with complaints of abdominal pain which has been ongoing for approximately two days. She denies any associated nausea, vomiting, or fever. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both of which are currently managed with medication.

On physical examination today, the abdomen is soft and non-distended. There is mild tenderness to palpation noted in the right lower quadrant, however there is no rebound tenderness or guarding appreciated.

My assessment is that this is likely gastritis, though we cannot completely rule out early appendicitis at this time.

The plan is to start her on Nexium 40 milligrams once daily for acid suppression. I have advised the patient to follow up with me in 48 hours for re-evaluation, or to proceed to the emergency room if her symptoms worsen before that time.
